* There will be Code
    code represents the details of the requirements. At some level those details cannot be ignored or abstracted; they have to be
    specified. And specifying requirements in such detail that a machine can execute them is programming. Such a specification is code

* Bad Code  
    Have you ever been significantly impeded by bad code? If you are a programmer of
    any experience then you’ve felt this impediment many times. Indeed, we have a name for
    it. We call it wading. We wade through bad code. We slog through a morass of tangled
    brambles and hidden pitfalls. We struggle to find our way, hoping for some hint, some
    clue, of what is going on; but all we see is more and more senseless code

* The total cost of owning a mess
    teams that were moving very fast at the beginning of a project can find themselves moving at a snail’s pace
    Over time the mess becomes so big and so deep and so tall, they can not clean it up. Thereis no way at all.

    - The grand redesign in the sky
        keeping your code clean is not just cost effective; it’s a matter of professional survival.

    - Attitude
        The managers and marketers look to us for the information they need to make promises and commitments; and even when they don’t look to us, we should not be shy
        about telling them what we think

    - The primal conundrum
        The only way to make the deadline—the only way to
        go fast—is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times

    - The art of clean code
        too being able to recognize clean code from dirty code does not mean that we know how to write clean code!
        A programmer with “code-sense” will look at a messy module and see options and variations
        a programmer who writes clean code is an artist who can take a blank screen through a series of transformations until it is an elegantly coded system.


    - What is Clean Code?
        There are probably as many definitions as there are programmers

* The Boy Scout Rule
    It’s not enough to write the code well. The code has to be kept clean over time
    "Leave the campground cleaner than you found it"
