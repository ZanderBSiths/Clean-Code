* Use intention-revealing names
    - The name of a variable, function, or class, should answer all the big questions. It
    should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used. If a name requires a comment, then the name does not reveal its intent. 

    bad example:
        int d; // elapsed time in days

    good example:
        int elapsedTimeInDays
    
    - Choosing names that reveal intent can make it much easier to understand and change code

* Avoid Disinformation
    - We should avoid words whose entrenched meanings vary from our intended meaning. For example,hp, aix, and sco
    - Do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an accountList unless itâ€™s actually a List.
        * If the container holding the accounts is not actually a List, it may lead to false conclusions.
        * So accountGroup or bunchOfAccounts or just plain accounts would be better
    - Spelling similar concepts similarly is information. Using incosisten spellings is disinformation

* Make meaningfil distinctions
