* Use intention-revealing names
    The name of a variable, function, or class, should answer all the big questions. It
    should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used. If a name requires a comment, then the name does not reveal its intent. 

    bad example:
        int d; // elapsed time in days

    good example:
        int elapsedTimeInDays
